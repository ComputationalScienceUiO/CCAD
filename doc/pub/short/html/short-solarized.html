<h2 id="___sec0">Vision </h2>

<p>
The new center should  seek to transform the University of Oslo (UiO) to
become a leader nationally and
internationally in scientific discovery through large-scale
computations and data-driven research. The aim is to position UiO as a leader in
computational and data sciences by recruiting faculty whose expertise pertains
to large-scale computing and mathematical foundations of data science - both generalists (algorithm/tool developers) and specialists
(focused on specific disciplines).

<p>
Scientific computing and data science play a central role in scientific investigations
and is central to innovation in most domains of our lives. It
underpins the majority of today's technological, economic and societal
feats. We have entered an era in which huge amounts of data offer
enormous opportunities, but only to those who are able to harness
them.  <a href="http://pathways.acm.org/executive-summary.html" target="_blank">By 2020, it is also expected that a large fraction of jobs in
the STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) fields
will be in computing</a>
(Association for Computing Machinery, 2013).

<p>
Furthermore, the <a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21553017" target="_blank">3rd Industrial Revolution</a> will alter significantly the demands on the workforce. To adapt a highly-qualified workforce to coming challenges  requires strong fundamental bases in STEM fields. Computational Science can provide such bases at all stages. Most of our students at both the undergraduate and the graduate level are unprepared to use computational modeling, data science, and high performance computing &#8211; skills valued by a very broad range of employers. The new center will also focus on the development of courses in computational science and data science tailored to the needs of the rest of society, both for the private and the public sector.

<p>
These developments, needs and future challenges, as well as
the developments which are now taking place within <a href="https://www.aps.org/publications/apsnews/201802/ostp.cfm?utm_source=APS+Physics+Main+Group&utm_campaign=fb7a2e7d6b-News+021218&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_825303224b-fb7a2e7d6b-106513221" target="_blank">quantum computing, quantum information</a> and data driven discoveries (data analysis and machine learning) will play an essential role in shaping future technological developments. Most of these developments require true cross-disciplinary approaches, approaches which normally cannot be accomplished within the realms of one single disciplinary-based department.

<h2 id="___sec1">Societal impact </h2>

<p>
The center should function as a hub for and coordinator of courses and study programs
in data science and computing across disciplines.
It should 

<ol>
<li> Participate in the development of  a comprehensive set of courses and degree programs at both undergraduate and graduate levels that will give students across the university exposure to practical computational methods, understanding how to analyse data and more generally to the idea of computers as problem-solving tools.</li> 
<li> Facilitate the adoption of computational tools and techniques for both research and education across campus, through education and faculty collaboration.</li> 
<li> Develop an all university PhD program in Computational Science and Data Science.</li>
<li> Develop courses and course modules in Computational Science and Data Science for the private and the public sectors.</li>
<li> Develop a new Bachelor of Science program in Data Science and Computing</li>
<li> Develop a Master of Science program and a PhD program in Computational Science and Data Science tailored to the needs of the private and the public sectors, allowing for students residing outside UiO to develop their knowledge about Computational Science and Data Science.</li>
<li> Be a driving force in the education of  the next generation of scientists and teachers,  with a strong focus on digital competences.</li> 
</ol>

The new center will be the first in Norway to comprehensively treat
computation as the triple point of algorithm development and analysis,
high performance computing, and disciplinary knowledge with
applications to scientific and engineering modeling and data
science. There is no such center in Norway, The above paradigm shift
recognizes computation as a new discipline rather than decomposed into
isolated sub-disciplines, enabling application-driven computational
modeling and data-driven discoveries, while also exposing disciplinary
computationalists to advanced tools and techniques, which will ignite
new transformational connections in research and education. This
research nexus also gives rise to the educational opportunities driven
by similar synergy, leveraging common resources among disciplines, and
enabling joint programs and unique degrees across the entire
computational space.

<h2 id="___sec2">Why should we focus on developing a center in Data Science and Computing? </h2>

<p>
Modern problems in science and engineering bridge a vast range of
temporal and spatial scales and include a wide variety of physical
processes. The analysis of such problems is not possible, so one must
turn to computation. To develop computational tools for such complex
systems that give physically meaningful insights requires a deep
understanding of approximation theory, high performance computing, and
domain specific knowledge of the area one is modeling. National
laboratories like <a href="https://www.simula.no/" target="_blank">SIMULA research lab</a> have
addressed the interdisciplinary nature of computing by having experts
in numerical algorithms co-located with disciplinary experts who have
a deep understanding of computation, and who use scientific computing
to address key topics in science.

<p>
The proposed organization with algorithmic scientists and disciplinary
scientists in STEM fields as well as other fields is what facilitates
the exploration of challenging multi-disciplinary and
interdisciplinary topics that could not otherwise be addressed. This
key observation motivates the model for the proposed center - a
place where we will attack the critical problems facing us in the 21st
century, problem which require the development of computing skills
across disciplines, from the traditional STEM fields to the
Humanities, Law, Educational Science and the Social Sciences.
Furthermore, this center would strive to use computing as a
critical tool to explore fundamental scientific questions in subjects
as diverse as the physics of specific materials, evolutionary biology
and data-driven economic forecasting. In addition, the synergy of
data-driven computational modeling, combining aspects of traditional
scientific computing with data science and data mining, is an exciting
topic that this new unit will be uniquely suited to address. This is a
rapidly emerging field that touches many of the STEM disciplines but
also Medicine, Education, the Humanities and the Social Sciences, and
attracting world-leading talent in this area can be greatly facilitated by
the introduction of the new center.
Furthermore, the development of the center has the potential to catapult UiO into
the position of being a leader in this critical new field, and will
open doors to new scientific challenges as well as new Center-level
funding opportunities.

<p>
The new center will enable new science through these unique
interdisciplinary collaborations and will become a focal point for
data science and computational science research at UiO, bringing
researchers in computational and data sciences together with domain
experts in astrophysics, bioinformatics, chemistry, geoscience
neuroscience, subatomic physics, materials science, life science, the
Humanities, economy, Education and many more.

<h3 id="___sec3">Strengths, Possibilities and Synergies </h3>

<p>
The University of Oslo has within several of the STEM fields strong research and educational activities, exemplified through for example:

<ul>
<li> Several Centers of excellence in research where Computational Science plays a major role</li>
<li> A newly established center of excellence in education research</li>
<li> Newly established Master of Science programs in Computational Science and Data Science</li>
<li> Several excellent groups in STEM fields that do Computational Science and Data Science</li>
<li> Computational topics are included in all undergraduate STEM programs, with the possibility to develop a bachelor program in Computational Science and Data Science for all university colleges</li>
<li> Several educational prizes and awards related to computational science</li> 
<li> Strong links with research laboratories like SIMULA research lab</li>
<li> UiO has the potential to develop cross-college educational programs in Computational Science and Data Science, from undergraduate programs to PhD programs that serve also the public and the private sectors</li>
<li> The courses to be developed can be offered to train employees and students outside UiO, serving thus the coming needs of for example Machine Learning for the public and the private sectors</li>
</ul>

With the new center we have the possibility to really position UiO as
the leading Norwegian and perhaps European institution within
Computational Science and Data Science.

<h2 id="___sec4">New and transformational science that can  be enabled by the new center  </h2>

<p>
Here are four major overarching themes which encompass many of the present and scientific directions of interest in data science and computing. Note that these overarching themes represent research interests of several of our MN-fak departments. There are also several links between all these main overarching topics.

<ul>
<li> <b>Data Science and Statistical analysis</b>, from algorithm development to applications (essentialll departments as well as the humanities, social sciences, law, medicine etc). This includes Machine Learning. Should we also include Artificial Intelligence in some way?</li>
<li> <b>Quantum information theory and quantum computing technologies</b> (Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry, Informatics, Materials Science), herein also traditional methods for quantum mechanical studies. It would bring in essential transformational technologies to UiO.</li> 
<li> <b>Computational modelling of high-dimensional, nonlinear and complex systems</b>. This overarching theme covers topics that span all departments, from math studies of say partial differential equations to applications in mechanics, meteorology, hydrology, astrophysics, life science etc etc.</li>
<li> <b>High-Performance computing</b>, from algorithms to applications.</li>
</ul>

What follows here is a selected list of possible fields of applications across departments and colleges.

<h3 id="___sec5">Computational life science </h3>

<p>
The Life Sciences is transforming with the explosion of
High-throughput data generation technologies and the need for
integrating these across all the levels of the biological hierarchy. A
'system-dynamic' (Systems Biology) approach will dominate research in
the coming decades. Here, computational modelling to integrate the
various data types and data sets will be a driving force. Similar
developments are seen in the field of molecular image analysis, where
computational methods to integrate the image streams will become
essential to make sense of the growing amount of data. Translational
Bioinformatics, bridging the gap between the laboratory, computer and
the clinic, with the ultimate goal of personalised medicine, is an
important, and exciting new dimension. Many of these developments
require cross-disciplinary thinking, and often breakthroughs in
Bioinformatics/Computational Life Science start with creatively
adjusting and implementing algorithmic or computational solutions
originally developed for other fields. A center that has
multidisciplinarity as its founding principle, and brings
computationally skilled researchers from many fields together, will
provide a solid foundation for researchers working towards these
developments.

<h3 id="___sec6">Develop data-driven discovery research programs utilizing recent developments in machine learning </h3>

<p>
 <b>Machine Learning</b> plays nowadays a central role in the analysis of
large data sets in order to extract information about complicated
correlations. This information is often difficult to obtain with
traditional methods. For example, there are about one trillion web
pages; more than one hour of video is uploaded to YouTube every
second, amounting to 10 years of content every day; the genomes of
1000s of people, each of which has a length of \( 3.0\times 10^9 \) base
pairs, have been sequenced by various labs and so on. This deluge of
data calls for automated methods of data analysis, which is exactly
what machine learning provides.  Developing activities in these
frontier computational technologies is thus of strategic importance
for our capability to address future science problems. The
applicability of big data, data-driven discoveries, data-driven
modeling and machine learning covers basically all disciplines and
fields, with applications spanning from materials science, mechanics,
medicine, applied mathematics, economic forecasting etc. Machine
learning and big data concepts are being exploited in more and more
fields.  The big data challenge will be in the forefront of biology
and life science research in the next few years.  In materials science
machine learning allows us to parametrize results from quantum
mechanical calculations in terms of classical interactions. These
interactions are in turn suitable for large scale molecular dynamics
simulations of complicated systems spanning from subatomic physics to
materials science and life science.  To develop a multiscale science
program starting with the smallest constituents and moving to larger
systems can most likely only be done with the development and
application of machine learning algorithms.  Economists and policy
makers need up-to-date information on the state of the economy to
formulate effective policies. Variables such as GDP, Gini factors,
unemployment rates, quality of life data etc are normally used as key
indicators. These data are often only available with delays between
collection and availiability to analysts, making it thus difficult to
asses properly their relevance. Machine learning algorithms have the
potential to deliver improved predictions as well as correlations and
proper error estimates. The examples discussed here represent just a
few of the possible applications of Machine Learning algorithms that
the new center can aid in developing. To develop these research
lines will be achieved most effectively within the new multidisciplinary
center.

<h3 id="___sec7">Develop research programs in Quantum Computing and Quantum Information theory </h3>

<p>
Enabling simulations of large-scale quantal many-particle systems is a
long-standing problem in scientific computing.  Quantum many-particle
interactions define the structure of the universe, from nucleons and
nuclei, to atoms, molecules, and even stars. Since the discovery of
quantum mechanics, a lot of progress has been made in understanding
the dynamics of certain many-particle systems. While some of our
insight comes from a small set of analytically solvable models,
numerical simulations have become a mainstay in our understanding of
many-particle dynamics. The progress in numerical simulations has
accelerated in the last few decades with the advent of modern high
performance computing (HPC) and clever developments in classical
simulation algorithms such as, quantum Monte Carlo,large-scale
diagonalization approaches, Coupled-Cluster theory and other
renormalization schemes.  Despite the monumental advances, classical
simulation techniques are reaching fundamental limits in terms of the
size of the quantum systems that can be processed. Fortunately, the
disruptive new field of quantum simulations has emerged, promising to
enable simulations far beyond those which are classically
tractable. In particular, scientific applications concerned with
simulations of interacting fermions on a lattice are poised to reap
the benefits of quantum simulations.  Mathematical models of
interacting fermions naturally extend to describe vastly different
physics such as that of correlated electronic and the correlated
nuclear systems.

<p>
 Recent progress in quantum computing as well as digital and analog
Quantum Algorithms (QAs) promise to enable the exciting possibility of
performing simulations that are beyond the reach of all existing and
future classical supercomputers. Despite the progress, there is still
a gap between the resources required by state-of-the-art QA and the
resources offered by available and near-future quantum hardware. It
may take decades of quantum hardware development and engineering
before the current QAs will outperform classical exascale class
simulations. Therefore, to impact scientific computing on a more
relevant time scale, improving the scalability and efficiency of
quantum simulation algorithms is of the highest
importance. Developments in quantum information algorithms and their
mathematical properties, as well as their applications will play a
critical role in studies of relevance for a wide variety of fields,
from the design and studies of new materials to our basic
understanding of systems of interest in chemistry and physics. The new
center, in close collaboration with disciplinary experts, can play
an essential role in developing this field by hiring world-leading
experts in quantum information theory and quantum computing.

<h3 id="___sec8">Computational Social Science </h3>

<p>
Survey data, the engine of the behavioral revolution of the social sciences is about to run its course, with low response rate and poorly representative samples being the norm rather than the exception.  Fortunately, vast amount of new information from social media, via digitalized governmental archives, to population registries are opening up new exiting avenues for innovative social science research, such as paternity leave and children&#8217;s performance in school, extent of censorship in Chinese online new reporting, or conditions for receptiveness to fake news. Moreover, the new data availability in combination with tools from machine-learning has spurred an interest in prediction and sophisticated policy-recommendations, ranging from optimize relocation of immigrants given their skill-set and local labor market needs, via probabilistic detection of election fraud, to forecasting of popular unrest and civil war. The undertaking of such research questions was, until recently, outside the realm of social science. There are however limits to the amount of new insights that can be obtained purely from richer data and &#8220;black-box&#8221; import of machine-learning tools. More robust, new insights require similar steps to be taken in the development of applied, testable, theoretical models to facilitate direct empirical evaluations of the model dynamics and the consistency of the model with the data. Such a step requires a solid grounding in computing.

<h3 id="___sec9">Computational Geoscience </h3>

<p>
Geoscience has long been a computationally-intensive area. A typical
climate simulation, used for example in the future projections
discussed by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), can
generate a petabyte (1 million gigabytes) of data. Weather forecasts
involve suites of complex simulations, which are then averaged to
assess the probability of different scenarios. These models simulate
not only the atmosphere, but the important interactions with the
ocean, land and vegetation. Sophisticated models are also used for
studying tectonic continental shifts, to understand the geology and
climate of previous epochs, thereby informing our understanding of
prehistoric life. And similar models are used to simulate hydrological
reservoirs and the melting occurring at the base of major
glaciers. Computation is so central to the geosciences that it is
impossible to imagine the study without it.

<p>
The computational approaches relevant for geoscience can be grouped in
two classes: simulation and analysis. Geoscientific computation
demands advance programming techniques and optimized simulations, to
ensure the fast calculations. Changes in the global ocean circulation
can take tens of thousands of years, demanding the most rapid
simulations possible. High performance computing approaches, for
example using graphical processing units (GPUs), are now being applied
to climate models, greatly increasing performance.  The large amount
of data generated by geophysical simulations is also a challenge and
is well-suited for big data techniques. Machine learning is beginning
to be used in weather forecasting and in climate simulations. This has
led to the identification of weather patterns missed by researchers
and to the identification of extreme events like cyclones and
&#8220;atmospheric rivers&#8221;, on par with that of human
analysts. Computational geoscience is an exciting and developing
field, and one which will make major inroads to the earth sciences in
the future.

<h3 id="___sec10">Computational Psychology </h3>

<p>
Large files of audio/video are currently unused since data is in a
form that is unavailable for quantitative analysis (such as video of
weekly clinical interviews from multi-center trials of treatment for
thousands of patients). Analysis of prosody can shed light on change
processes, and should automatic transcription reach a sufficiently
good level, this will, in combination with natural language
processing, open up many interesting research questions.

<p>
Accumulated data from online use already provides measurements of
quantities such as personality, attitudes, skills or mental disorders
which in many cases have proven to approach the level of the best
instruments we have. Here one obtain much more, especially since
clinical treatment will increasingly be supplemented by electronic
registrations in the future, as well as being able to disconnect data
from sensors in smart devices. Present instruments in use generate
relatively large amounts of data (from for example EEG, ERP, and fMRI), and newer
methods of pattern recognition/classification can shed light on a
number of research questions.

<h3 id="___sec11">Machine learning in education research </h3>

<p>
Quantitative education research has historically been done at the
micro-scale (classrooms) and the macro-scale (K-12, baccalaureate
degree programs, etc.). Micro-scale research has been done using
traditional correlational statistics with data gathered from surveys,
conceptual tests, classroom observations, etc. With the advent of the
<em>digital classroom</em> student behavior can now be examined in fine
grain. Students access of online homework platforms, video lectures,
and interactions with peers via online course forums has created new
data sources for education researchers. New technologies such as
computer textual analysis can pick apart student conceptual
understanding of hard concepts in science and mathematics. Intelligent
tutors can provide real time feedback to students as they solve
problems. At the macro-scale students&#8217; career decisions within their
programs can be modeled. What courses they choose to take, who they
choose to take courses from, and their comments on said courses, form
new data sets which can be used to predict student decisions and
provide timely feedback to students and faculty advisers. Ultimately
these data sets can form a high dimensional picture of student
learning painted by machine learning.
