<h2 id="___sec0" class="anchor">Why should we focus on Computational Science and Data Science? </h2>

<ul>
<li> <a href="http://pathways.acm.org/executive-summary.html" target="_self">By 2020, it is expected that one of every two jobs in the STEM fields will be in computing</a> (Association for Computing Machinery, 2013)</li>
<li> Computation is an essential and cross-cutting element of all STEM disciplines</li>
<li> Computational science has developed into a discipline of its own right</li>
<li> Computations and the understanding of large data sets will play an even larger role in basically all disciplines of STEM fields, Medicine, the Social Sciences, the Humanities and  education</li>
<li> Students at both undergraduate and graduate level are unprepared to use computational modeling, data science, and high performance computing &#8211; skills valued by a very broad range of employers.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="___sec1" class="anchor">Goals </h3>

<ul>
<li> Position UiO  as a leader in computational science by recruiting faculty whose expertise pertains to large-scale computing and mathematical foundations of data science - both generalists (algorithm/tool developers) and specialists (focused on specific disciplines).</li>	
<li> Develop a comprehensive set of courses and degree programs at both undergraduate and graduate levels that will give students across the university exposure to practical computational methods, understanding how to analyse data and more generally to the idea of computers as problem-solving tools.</li>	
<li> Facilitate the adoption of computational tools and techniques for both research and education across campus, through education and faculty collaboration. A center and then a department will facilitate the pursuit of these goals!</li>	
<li> Educate the next generation of school teachers and university teachers,  with a strong focus on digital competences.</li> 
</ul>

<h2 id="___sec2" class="anchor">Strengths, Possibilities and Synergies </h2>

<ul>
<li> Several Centers of excellence in research where Computational Science plays a major role</li>
<li> Newly established center of excellence in education research</li>
<li> Newly established Master of Science programs in Computational Science and Data Science</li>
<li> Several excellent groups in STEM fiels who do Computational Science</li>
<li> Computational topics are included in all undergraduate STEM programs, possibility to develop a bachelor program in Computational Science</li>
<li> Several educational prizes and awards related to computational science</li> 
<li> With a center and later a department we have the possibility to really position UiO as the leading Norwegian and perhaps European institution within Computational Science and Data Science</li>
<li> Lead in the development of computations in Life Science</li>
<li> Strong links with SIMULA research lab</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="___sec3" class="anchor">Enhance Computational Science and Data Science across the disciplines </h2>

<p>
Data driven discovery and data driven modeling play already a central role in research. The global objective here is to strengthen and coordinate such activities by bringing together scientists and students across the disciplines.
UiO has already strong computational research and education activities within Mathematics and the Natural Sciences.
The aim here is to extend this to include

<ul>
<li> Computational Science and data science in Mathematics and all of the physical sciences</li>
<li> Computational biology and life science (includes medicine)</li>
<li> Computational economics and data science and computing in the social science</li>
<li> Data science and computing in the Humanities</li>
</ul>

The new department will host and coordinate research and educational programs in Computational Science and Data Science. In particular research and education that onvolve  data analysis and machine Learning will play a central role here.

<h2 id="___sec4" class="anchor">The Center/Department </h2>

<ul>
<li> Administratively located under the Mat-Nat college</li>
<li> Composed of 25-30 full time equivalent positions, including some current UiO faculty and when it becomes a department a larger number of new hires.</li>
<li> Most of these faculty will have joint appointments with other units and/or departmentz at the University of Oslo and SIMULA research laboratory. As an example, one can have a 70% appointment in Mathematics and 30% at the new department.</li> 
<li> Faculty will focus on computational science, data science and large-scale and high-performance computation</li>	
<li> Faculty will be incentivized to engage in cross disciplinary and cross-department/college research collaborations</li>	
<li> Nurturing environment to attract these faculty and pursue large and interdisciplinary grants</li>	
<li> Close ties to SIMULA research laboratory and the HPC center at USIT</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="___sec5" class="anchor">Benefits  </h2>

<ul>
<li> Recruitment of new faculty who are incentivized to collaborate across the university both in terms of research and education.</li>
<li> Opportunities for existing UiO faculty to expand their computation-related capabilities, and to train students to use computational techniques.</li>	
<li> Broad and deep educational opportunities for both undergraduate and graduate students across the university.</li>	
</ul>

<h2 id="___sec6" class="anchor">Research opportunities </h2>

<ul>
<li> Data driven discovery and data-driven modeling where machine learning plays a central role</li>
<li> Research challenges that require computation-oriented multidisciplinary and interdisciplinary approaches.</li>	
<li> Research problems that require &#8220;bleeding edge&#8221; (e.g., multi-petaflop/petabyte) computational approaches to interpret experimental data and complex data.</li>
<li> Computational and data science research and education scattered across many departments. New department can strengthen computational science.</li> 	
<li> Develop research programs on Quantum Computing, the future of computing.  <a href="https://www.chalmers.se/en/news/Pages/Engineering-of-a-Swedish-quantum-computer-set-to-start.aspx" target="_self">The Wallenberg foundation in Sweden and Chalmers University of technology have funded a project on developing quantum computing technologies with SEK 1 billion</a>. The aim is to position  Sweden in  a top global top position in quantum technology.</li> 
<li> Center-level funding opportunities (e.g., SFF, Marie Curie etc etc).</li>	
</ul>

<h2 id="___sec7" class="anchor">More research opportunities </h2>

<p>
In Norway it is only UiO which offers a Masters program on Computational Science and Data Science. Al other universities have only Master programs on Computer Science. The University of Bergen has a Masters program on Applied Mathematics while UMB has only a Masters on Bioinformatics and Data analysis. These are limited and more focused programs. Nationally, UiO is the only university which offers broad programs in Computational Science and Data Science.

Out of 95 universities polled in the USA, there are less than 15 which have a department on Scientific Computing
and more than 50 that have a center on Scientific Computing. Between 20 to 30 of these offer a bachelor, Master of Science or PhD program. On Data Science there are approximately 30 departments and 40 centers. Almost 50 of these universities offer a Masters degree in Data Science and close to 40 a PhD in Data Science. 
An excellent example of a department which includes computational science and data science is the newly established <a href="https://cmse.msu.edu/" target="_self">department at Michigan State University</a>.

<p>
At the time of writing, no such poll has been made for European universities. From the list over Masters programs, the countries with the largest focus on these topics are Germany, Sweden and Switzerland.

<p>
The goal in Oslo is to establish a department which covers both Computational Science and Data Science across colleges and disciplines. The department will be responsible for these educational programs and oversee that a coherent and modern selection of courses is offered and developed. The courses should reflect the needs of society at large as well as the specific research projects.  This will give UiO a unique position in Norway.

<p>
The Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics (SIAM) <a href="https://www.siam.org/students/resources/cse_programs.php" target="_self">keeps track of graduate programs in computational Science</a>. The list is most likely not complete.
