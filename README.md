# Center for Computing-across the Disciplines (CCAD)
This folder is a placeholder for long term strategic planning of several stages in research applications, with a common denominator Computing Across Disciplines (CAD). It includes both a white paper and talking slides. The material serves as input to discussions on Computational Scence and Data Science at UiO. The material here has in turn been used as input for a recent recommendation to the College of Natural Science and Mathematics of the University of Oslo. A center is now been discussed instead of a department. There are several postive signals about this. The hope is to establish a center by 2020 on Data Science and Computing.
